Boston Python events are intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees at all Boston Python events, whether officially sponsored by Boston Python or not.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any Boston Python event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Our Standards

Boston Python is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of event participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Sexual language and imagery in any event venue, including talks
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

Thank you for helping make Boston Python a welcoming, friendly group for all.

### Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at event venues, including but not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## Scope

All Boston Python attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes staff and volunteers, as well as attendees of events, presentations, project nights, after-event gatherings, receptions, and all sponsored or unofficial events.

Communication outside of events are also subject to the Code of Conduct, including email, online postings, chat messages, and any other communication under the auspices of Boston Python.
